# Beijing Housing Prices Analysing and Predicting
The task is to build a model of housing price in Bejing. There are many models about housing price in Western City such as California or Boston, which do not have much relevent to property in Viet Nam. Therefore, I want to build a model about Bejing, which is near Viet Nam. So, I hope I can have big picture about house price in China, which have much relevent to my country.

Dataset is get from Kaggle Competition.

In this project, I used Pandas to clean and wrangling data. Then, I built machine learning models by different algorithms such as Linear Regresstion, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest. Models are evaluated by RMSE metric.
